there is some things diffrent beteween mysql and postgresql. for migration from mysql to
cockroachdb with postgresql api, we have some consideration diffrent between them:

-in mysql columns is escaped with `` in postgres with ""
 we must in fututer versin of mysql templte use "" and set mysql config to use ANSI_SQL
 this way both templte clouns will use ""
-mysql use ? and postgres use $1 for rows, we have in oure postgresql has succesfuly set $N
  and it working, we just need for mysql change that $N to ? for any N and that will work
  for both the databases
-mysql uses 'replace into' , postgres uses 'upsert'; in xo we have method .Replace() for mysql
   and .Upsert() for postgresql
-in postgresl id of last inserted won't retuern automaticly we need '... RETURNING "Id" '
-maybe for search postgersql use something other than % -- research this for LIKE %


this is all the main diffrence between this two databases with api that we uses



we are better off using mysql with inoodb, my benchmark has showed that
 it work very well, postgersql on the other hand was overkill, slower, hard to debug,
 it had vey bad performance for mixing of CRUD, mysql was much more better
when our database has grow much more larger we will benchmark cockroachdb or we just
 use one sloution of sharding of mysql or use vitnes of youtube, we NEVER will use
  postgersql directly, just mysql and maybe cockroachdb
